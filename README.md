# Smart-Trash_Bin
IoT based Garbage disposal System


Team: Halloblynk

Project: Smart Trash Bin


The root cause and challenge to the “Health and Social Welfare” is the improper management of waste. As tackling the root cause of diseases and serenity of the nature at the root level can eliminate the cause thereby taking our society to a new dimension by preventing 50% health problems caused by the waste(as insect and other microbes grow in the trash bin and spread epidemics also get into our food chain if its near the river) . Garbage around the world has been a problem  that generates many environmental damages too. And the aim is to protect the species that live there.
Our project  focuses on automating and networking garbage bins that are in various parts of city.

1.Each garbage bin has got a ultrasonic ping sensor using which it can be determined whether the bin is empty or not or how much % of the bin is filled.

2.It has got temperature, humidity, moisture sensors which helps to determine weather conditions and accordingly plan garbage disposals.

3.It has got a gyro through which it can known whether the bin has fallen and all the rubbish came out, if such a thing happens emergency alert is given to both the waste disposal authorities and also to the people.

4.All the garbage bins around the city are connected to a server using “Internet Of Things” and the server monitors which bins and filled and which are not and its plans the shortest possible route to go and collects the garbage(contrary to the custom of going through a fixed oath from the base station and coming back thereby preventing the wastage of fossil fuel and can contribute to the social welfare) and displays the route in the Google maps or any other appropriate software. This in large scale can save tones of fossil fuel.


5. We  also created an application for smart phones(using blynk platform) where you can observe the state of the sensors and also offers notifications depending on the state of the sensors. The main objective is that when the level of the trash can has a level of trash to the maximum, this sends a notification to all the users of the application and they make the collection and the cleaning of the place.
6. The data collected by the sensors forms a big data by time going and can be analyzed to know the rate of waste forming and can teach people in locality and make them aware about the bad effects of it thereby we can move to world of less and less waste. Also this raw data collected can predict many such things.
7. In further advancement the trash bin will be given robotic moving capability thereby it can move itself to dumb yard and can come back to the place when it is full.
